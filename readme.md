# RECT (python source code)
Network Embedding with Completely-imbalanced Labels. TKDE2020 [paper](https://zhengwang100.github.io/pdf/TKDE20_wzheng.pdf).
This is a deep method for the problem of [Zero-shot Graph Embedding (ZGE)](https://zhengwang100.github.io/project/zero_shot_graph_embedding.html), i.e., graph embeddings when labeled data cannot cover all classes. 

Breifly, RECT contains two parts:
---
- RECT-L is the supervised part in which a semantic loss is used. 
- RECT-N is the unsupervised part in which the network structure is preserved. Note, this part can be replaced by any unsupervised NRL methods.


Usage (abstract):
---
- set the dataset 
- python main_rect.py

```
------ evaluate RECT-N ---------
Training an SVM classifier under the pre-defined split setting...
